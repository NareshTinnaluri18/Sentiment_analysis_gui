2. i usually get irritated when there is no one to help, especially teachers. their lack of support and strange attitudes towards us, students, hamper our peace of mind. thereafter, the fear of scoring top grades in exams haunts us continuously.

3. the vast range of syllabi of all subjects and limited time to study each topic bothers me a lot. it frustrates me.

4. yes, there is constant pressure on me to perform well in my academics. it pains my heart to sense this kind of suffering.

5. there are several distractions to name, such as elements of entertainment, pursuing hobbies, playing sports and games and so on and forth.

6. yes, i get confused during the course of my studies. especially, when the topic is too abstract or difficult to digest or comprehend. it leads to confusion and i get stressed up.

7. of course, i do believe that i may know everything, yet i am being poked by a few teachers and parents that i need to do a lot. i admit that i cant know everything at once, but i endeavour to make it perfect.

8. mostly yes, because there is some kind of fear that makes me tense about how i will be perceived by my teacher and fellow classmates.

9. no, i dont feel so because it is the gospel truth that education is the key to a better form of living. it reminds me of an american proverb - “when the going gets tough, the tough get going”. yes, it is a battlefield and we, students, are the soldiers to accomplish our goals in order to obtain a great life. in ideal circumstances, no student has to be a soldier and the appropriate government should foster our needs and requirements.

10. i tend to compare myself with almost everyone. the element of competition in our environment is so toxic that it compels anyone to make comparisons and be at the topmost position.

323,"1)the 1st problem that everyone face i guess is not getting a good guide/faculty. it depends on luck whether you will get a good faculty or not. some faculties teaches very well. some are not able to explain concepts well. a solution for this problem could be that any teaching related organisation should select some students randomly and the new faculty should be made to give lecture to those students and if majority of students approve the faculty then only the faculty should be hired. secret ballot method should be used for voting.
2) exams:- the exams which evaluates the students based on your memorising ability are useless and just adds stress to a student's life. 
exams should be more practical based.
3) compulsory attendance:- universities make it compulsory for every student to take admission in a college for giving a university exam and get a degree. thats totally unfair. students should be allowed to give university exam even if they have not taken admission in any college.what if someone doesnt have enough money to pay fees... what if someone doesnt want to waste time by traveling to collect and attend lectures which they dont understand and just do self-study .

324,"the main cause is focus, it's not distraction but it's because of too many options in the current world. in this era people are not just following a career path, they are constantly making new paths. and we as teenagers are standing at the point to decide what will make us feel happy and satisfied for next 40 years and that's not an easy task. for example playing video games is considered as ""time wasting"" even i never played any, but then the truth is gaming industry is the biggest industry world wide today. so was i wrong to never touch any video games? people are making millions out of it, and in 2022 money is the only motive. but such career paths are still extraordinary thing for us. it's hard to make people understand we can vlog ourselves and make a career out of it. but then such careers are like stars in the sky, i can admire them but never touch them. *resources* lack of resources makes us feel paralyzed. the difference between the current trend and the theoretical knowledge we are getting from the books is a point of great concern. the world is moving forward with blockchain, metaverse, crypto and there is an indeed absence of such topics in our syllabus. the curriculum mainly focuses on preparing students wrt to companies but what if someone wants to explore through freelancing or startup. students should have liberties towards empowering themselves as personalities but with the current theories and syllabus there's too much focus on technical subjects and for someone who is good at management skills it becomes hard to decide the right path. from the age of 19-23 i will attend this degree but in this four years there's no help for me to understand finance in life and related knowledge. to cope with the current smartest generation of all time, the core functions should be reconstructed. studying is hard for me cause it's deeply concerntrated with studying technical. or else i've to do something extraordinary but then again the theoretical race i am running from 15 years showed me that i am not that extraordinary smart human. maybe i am not running the right race but there's no time left to decide the right and wrong and stick to what i have.

the solution is teaching focus to the teens, there's a heavy lack of philosophy and brain teaching in our country. how to control it, how to use it and how to take decisions. teaching ethics and values from childhood.","distracted,upset","careless,upset",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.931034483,"{'waste': 'careless', 'wrong': 'upset'}","{'careless': 80, 'upset': 60}"
